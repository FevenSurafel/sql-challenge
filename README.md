Designed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using QuickDBD to illustrate table relationships.

## Data Engineering

Developed table schemata for each CSV file, considering data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
Ensured precise ordering of table creation 
Successfully imported CSV data into the corresponding SQL tables
