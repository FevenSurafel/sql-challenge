# SQL Challenge: Employee Data Analysis

## Background
This project is part of a research assignment at Pewlett Hackard, focusing on analyzing employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. The task involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis using six CSV files.

## Data Modeling

Conducted a thorough inspection of six CSV files.
Designed an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using QuickDBD to illustrate table relationships.

## Data Engineering

Developed table schemata for each CSV file, considering data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
Ensured precise ordering of table creation 
Successfully imported CSV data into the corresponding SQL tables

## Data Analysis
Executed a series of SQL queries to derive meaningful insights
